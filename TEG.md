## üîéBusiness Task

### üëâüèºIntroduction

"Telangana, a southern state in India, situated on the Deccan Plateau, boasts a rich history, vibrant culture, and a reputation for innovation. With 33 districts, it has emerged as one of India's fastest-growing states, showcasing an impressive average annual growth rate of 13.90% in the last five years. In 2020-21, Telangana achieved a nominal Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of ‚Çπ13.59 lakh crore.

One of the key drivers of Telangana's success has been its commitment to open data initiatives. The Telangana Open Data Policy, launched in 2016, stands out as a beacon of transparency and accountability. This policy not only makes government data freely accessible but also fosters public participation in governance. It has led to the creation of innovative applications and services, fueling economic growth.

I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the Telangana government for championing open data. This initiative has not only made information more transparent and accessible to citizens, businesses, and researchers but has also been instrumental in propelling the state's economic prosperity."

### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èProblem Statement

‚Ä¢ Explore Stamp Registration, Transportation and Ts-Ipass Datasets.Understand their attributes, categories and time period.

‚Ä¢ Analyze trends and patterns within each department.

‚Ä¢ Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention.

‚Ä¢ Find correlation among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals such as shape maps.

### Insights

- The revenue generated from document registration and e-stamp challans varies across districts in Telangana. In some districts, the revenue from e-stamp challans is significantly more than the revenue from document registration. In other districts, the revenue from document registration is significantly more than the revenue from e-stamp challans.

### Insights

- The introduction of e-Stamp challans has revolutionized the way stamp duty is paid in Telangana. This makes the process much more convenient and efficient.As a result of the introduction of e-Stamp challans, there has been a significant increase in the number of e-Stamp challans issued. In fact, the number of e-Stamp challans issued in FY 2022 was more than double the number issued in FY 2021. However, there has also been a slight decrease in the number of document registrations. This is because many people are now using e-Stamp challans to pay stamp duty without actually registering their documents.

üìå**Q-4 Categorize districts into three segments based on their stamp registration revenue generation during the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.**

### Insights

The distribution of vehicles varies significantly by vehicle class across different districts. For instance, in the vehicle class of motorcycles, the district of Hyderabad has the highest number of vehicles, followed by the districts of Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri. This is because these districts are more urbanized and have a higher population density. In contrast, the district of Adilabad has the lowest number of motorcycles, followed by the districts of Karimnagar and Warangal. This is because these districts are more rural and have a lower population density.

### Insights

- We can say, There is a weak positive relationship between district investments, vehicles sales, and stamps revenue within the same district between FY 2021 and 2022. This means that districts with higher investments tend to have higher vehicle sales and stamps revenue. This is because investments lead to economic growth, which in turn leads to an increase in demand for vehicles and stamps.

The construction sector also tends to experience higher investments during the summer months, when there is less rainfall .The IT sector typically experiences higher investments during the months of October to December, as this is the time when the companies start their annual budgeting process. The manufacturing sector, on the other hand, typically experiences higher investments during the months of January to March, as this is the time when the companies start their new financial year.However, there are also some sectors that do not follow any particular seasonal patterns. They receive investments all over the year based on the demand.

üìå**What significant policies or initiatives were put into effect to enhance economic growth, investments, and employment in Telangana by the current government? Can we quantify the impact of these policies using available data?**

- Policies for Economic Growth, Investments, and Employment in Telangana :
- Industrial Promotion : `TS-iPASS` streamlined industrial approvals to attract investment.
- Industrial Parks : `ITIR` (Information Technology & investment Region) and Pharma City aimed to attract IT and pharma investments.
- Innovation Support : `TSIC` (Telangana State Innovation Cell) and T-Hub supported startups and innovation.
- Startup Assistance : Idea to Market `I2M` aided startups from ideation to market entry.
- Textile and Food : Policy focused on boosting the textile industry for job creation and focused on food processing tech.
- Rural Employment : `TREGS` (Telangana Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) provided rural job opportunities.
- Infrastructure Projects : `Mission Bhagiratha` and `Mission Kakatiya` addressed water and irrigation needs, generating rural employment.

It is difficult to quantify with the available data , But there is no doubt that ‚ÄúTELANGANA‚Äù is one of the youngest and Fastest growing states in India.

- Challenges in Quantifying Impact
- Policies may take years to show full effect. Economic growth influenced by various external factors.
- Reliable data on economic indicators and investments is essential.
- Comparing actual outcomes with policy absence is complex.
- Policies may have indirect and long-term effects, creating feedback loops.
